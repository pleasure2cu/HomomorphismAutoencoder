# Homomorphism Autoencoder
This is my implementation of the Homomorphism Autoencoder by [Keurti et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12067) The authors have created a repo with the official code, which can be found [here](https://github.com/hamzakeurti/homomorphismvae).
This repo here is intended to provide an easier entry for people who just want a barebone implementation in a simple repo.


# Usage
Should you be interested in using the HAE in your project then you only need the code from **homomorphism_autoencoder.py**.
The file **minimal_example.py** shows you in a commented manner how to use the HAE implementation.
The remaining files are all used for the example and/or validation.

## Acknowledgement

I would like to thank Hamza Keurti (the lead author from the paper) for answering my questions and correcting my misconceptions patiently.
